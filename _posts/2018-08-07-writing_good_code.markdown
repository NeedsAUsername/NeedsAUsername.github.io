One of the important takeaways of the cirriculum is the idea of writing good code. For example, if you find yourself repeating the same lines of code, it is a good idea to condense that into a method. This works with individual methods too; if a method is doing more than two things at once it can be helpful to seperate it into two methods, and write a new method that just calls on those two methods. As for folders, and files, you should organize them according to what they do. Put the models in the models folder, the controllers in the controllers folder, and so forth. Organizing our code not only makes it easier for us to plan out and write our program, it is easier for other people to jump into your program and see what it does. If nobody paid attention to the structure of their code, it would be very difficult to collaborate, and adding features would be a struggle when you're lost in a sea of text.

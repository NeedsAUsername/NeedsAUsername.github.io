I was majoring in finance and heard that python was useful to know, so I spent a summer between Junior and Senior year to try and learn it. I became fascinated with programming and the idea of have my code come to life in the form of a program. I ended up following a youtube tutorial on creating a space shooter game using pygame, and I was really proud of what I had done, even though I didn't understand half the stuff that the tutorial video covered. At the end of that summer I looked at my options. Most of the available entry-level jobs in the finance sector involved either sales work (selling insurance or investment products)  or analysis work on stocks. Neither really appealed to me, and I began to see coding as a realistic alternative career path for the first time. I was still very interested in the market and trading as a personal hobby, so I finished my finance degree, and here I am at bootcamp, ready to learn to code for a living!

I've recently been using Pramp to help prepare for technical interviews. It's a site that pairs you up with someone else for 60 hour interview sessions. You're interviewed for half the session, and you interview your partner for the other half. I really like the dual-role aspect of each session. It's insightful to see how other people approach problems, and putting myself in the interviewer's shoes gave me an idea of what interviewers are looking for and how to best communicate to them. Pramp's questions were definitely challenging, and I managed to solve my first one with some hints, but was totally lost on my second session. I've realized that it's not just about getting the solution; the thought-process behind your approach and your ability to communicate to the interviewer is just as important. I'll continue to practice and gain confidence when it comes time for the real deal!

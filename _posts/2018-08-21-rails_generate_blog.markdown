The rails framework is truly amazing in how it simplifies many of the tasks that developers would otherwise do manually. The rails generator especially stands out to me because it is able to create migrations, models, controllers, and resources with just one line! The scaffold generator goes one step further and creates all the routes and views as well( usint it to create a functional website almost instantaniously is definitely something you can impress your friends with). However, the convenience that the rails generator brings comes at a cost. While the scaffold may seem impressive, it creates a lot of files that you have to sift through and edit or delete. In many cases, the resource generator is the most ideal one to use; it takes care of the core back-end work, while leaving you to customize the routes and views to fit your version of the website layout.

I've started learning React, and the ideas of components with props and states is mind-blowing. It's such an innovative way of controlling front end interaction, and I'm no longer surprised why React is so popular now. React divides sections of your webpage into easily managed components. With setState, you can easily change a component's state with an event listener, and React will automatically detect differences in the rendering of the componenet and update the browser! No more need for manually adding event listeners and functions into your HTML. In fact, no more need for jQuery at all, since React uses plain Vanilla Javascript and JSX!

CSS controls how elements appear on a webpage. Javascript changes CSS. That's it!. If you want a button that pops open an image, you can just hide the image with display:none and have the button use an onclick trigger to change the display:none to display:block. This way, you can design content to be shown on the same page without going to another url, and you can do it in style too. If you do this with lots of coordinated images really fast, it will appear to be animated (and this is how gifs work!) You can optimize this by having just one image element, and change the source of the image such that the one element ends up displaying numerous different images, instead of having a hundred image elements and going through all of them and turning their individual displays on or off. Now the youtube thumbail previews  aren't so mysterious any more, are they?

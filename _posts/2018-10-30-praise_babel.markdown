<p>
The tower of Babel, part of an ancient story that tried to explain the existence of multiple languages, was a tower that was built during a time when all humans spoke the same language. Just as the Babel tower symbolized a unity of language, so too does the Babel compiler. It takes all the versions of Javascript, fancy ES6 syntax and all, and compiles them down to basic Javascript that all browsers support and understand. This enables us to program with the most up to date syntax without needing to worry about any backward compatability. Thanks, Babel!

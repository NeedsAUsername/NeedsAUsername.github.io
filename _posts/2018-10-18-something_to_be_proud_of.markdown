The time has come. This is it. I wanted a workout journal website, and now I've built one, full of all the functionality and ease of use that I'd envisioned it to have. Well, there's still losts to do; I've got to fix the css for mobile viewing and there's so much more cool things that I want to build, like progress charts. But the core functionality is here! I can create routines, and log workouts, with just a few clicks! I've learned a lot, and discovered that building a site from scratch is tough, and there's a lot of roadblocks that made my head hurt. Every time I wanted to implement something, whether it was interactive nested forms, or interactive nested forms within interactive nested forms(yikes), or figuring out the correct database relationships to implement, getting an AJAX function to work properly, or trying to deploy to heroku, I realized that I knew close to nothing at the start of every new venture. It's one things to just read about how something works, and think you know how it works. It's an entirely different thing to try to build it yourself, and not just build an arbitrary example of it, but to build a complex version that's tailored towards your own program.  Every hurdle was a humbling experience, and every hours-long session of searching stack overflow, going through the debugger in the console countless times, checking my databases, params, controllers, views, until finally, finally, I've created code that does what I want it to, and I leave with a deeper understanding of exactly how it works, as well as a deep sense of satisfaction as I close twenty tabs on my chrome.

In my preparation for technical interviews, I decided to start tackling some leetcode problems. I began the easiest problems with confidence. After all, these were easy level questions and shouldn't be too hard since I have to solve them with pure ruby right? Nope. Even the easiest leetcode problems were a struggle. I managed to pull through several of them, and they were not beyond my current knowledge, but I was genuinely surprised at how much difficulty I had in solving the problems. I took them step by step, and my final solutions were definitely not the most elegant, filled with more code than what was probably necessary to solve the problem. It wasn't just code knowledge itself that gave me a hard time( I had to open up the irb just to remind myself that the output of individual pieces of code were indeed what my memories thought they were). The problems had an intense problem-solving aspect, that I realized was going to be vital to my programming career. Even if you knew every syntax of ruby, you still had to pick and choose the right tools and in the right order. Even if you arrive at a solution, there are often more efficient lines of code that do the same thing. For now, my goal is to continue solving the easy level questions, and in the future I can come back to them and refactor my old code to be better (hopefully by then I'll have the know-how to do so!).

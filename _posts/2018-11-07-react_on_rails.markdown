So, it's time to write my final project for Flatiron! Up until now, I didn't understand how frontend could be seperated from the backend. After all, all my previous projects were built on Rails, where the MVC all lived together in one repo. After learning Javascript, I discovered you could fetch information from your rails app, and use javascript to attach that info to the DOM, but my frontend was still coded in the Rails views directory. Now, I'm going to expand on the idea of Rails acting just as a  backend API, and use React to render my entire frontend! My React app is simply going to send and receive data from my Rails backend; besides fetch, the frontend and backend and completely seperate, and therefore they can even live in two different repositories! It's definitely become a weird transition. I started off learning very back-end focused topics from SQL, to ORMs, to Rails with models and controllers. Now, all of that is falling to the side as an API, and my focus is shifting towards the frontend, with React, javascript, and CSS! I feel like I've journeyed back and forth, and can finally call myself a full-stack developer!

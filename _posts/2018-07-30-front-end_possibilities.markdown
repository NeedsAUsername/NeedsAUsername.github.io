Writing HTML and CSS is very different from writing Ruby or Javascript. You need to focus on how something is displayed rather than how something works. It requires a different set of skills. There are endless ways to customize and design a website. There are so many things to take into consideration, like the positioning and sizes of different content. Even things like the screen size of your device plays a role in how content is displayed, and that's something I never thought about until now.  There are so many different options and I feel like I could spend days touching up a website just as an artist could spend days touching up a painting.

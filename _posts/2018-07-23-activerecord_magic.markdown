I spent days following Flatiron's ORM section, learning to write my own ORM methods, and then I was introduced to ActiveRecord- which did all of that work for me! I felt a mix of emotions, as I realized that all my lines of code could be condensed into a single "< ActiveRecord::Base". I was happy that I would never have to write those methods again, and at the same time little dismayed for the exact same reason.  I would never directly write those methods that I spent so much time to learn about, but activerecord's methods would allow me to tap into them with ease. I realized that learning the underlying methods the hard way was necessary for me to grasp and appreciate ActiveRecord's underlying methods, otherwise it would just seem like magic to me!
